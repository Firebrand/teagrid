# TeaGrid
A tiny but powerful css grid framework. Emulates most of Bootstrap's grid in just a couple lines of SCSS code!

**tea.scss** is the only file you need.

### TeaGrid classes and their Bootstrap equivalents

| Bootstrap | TeaGrid |
| ------ | ------ |
| container | tea-container |
| row | tea-row |
| col | tea-col |
| col-6 | tea-col6 |
| col-6-md | tea-col6-md |

### Further documentation

The /test folder contains the Bootstrap 4.2 documentation for their grid, but under each example you'll find the TeaGrid version as well.
This is used for both documentation and testing purposes.
